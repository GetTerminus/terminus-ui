This is a stream of query strings\nentered by the user.

This function should match the type {@link TsAutocompleteComparatorFn} which has the basic signature of (v: any) => string.\nThis comparator function will be used by the autocomplete to determine if a selection is a\nduplicate. It is also used as the trackBy function when looping through options.\nSeed selected values\nTo seed initial values, pass the array of selections to initialSelections:\nShow the progress indicator\nShow a progress indicator by toggling the showProgress value:\nthis.isInProgress = true;Customize how the selected value is displayed\nThe UI display of selected options can be changed by passing in a custom displayWith function.\nThis function should match {@link TsAutocompleteFormatterFn} which has the signature of (v) =>\nstring;\n\n v.login\"\n>Event driven\nIf a FormControl isn't needed, you can subscribe to events directly:\nadded(chip) {\n  console.log('Selection made!', chip);\n}\n\nremoved(chip) {\n  console.log('Selection removed!', chip);\n}\n\nchange(selections) {\n  console.log('Selection was changed!', selections);\n}Show a 'no results' validation error\nIf no results are found, set a validation error on the FormControl:\nthis.users$ = this.auto\n  .query\n  .pipe(\n    startWith(null),\n    switchMap((term) => {\n      if (term) {\n        // Hit the API with the query\n        return this.http.get(`${GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT}/search/users?q=${term}`)\n          .pipe(\n            map((response: Response) => {\n              const items = response['items'];\n\n              // If no results are found, notify the user via a validation message\n              if (items.length Minimum required character count\nBy default, two characters must be entered before a query is emitted.

My checkbox label\nReactive Forms\nTo use the checkbox with a reactive form, pass the formControl to the checkbox:\n\n  I will be checked if `myControl.value` is true.\nngModel\nTo use the checkbox with Angular's ngModel, just attach the directive to the checkbox:\n\n  I will be checked if `myValue` is true.\nisChecked\nTo seed the initial checked state use the isChecked property:\n\n  I will be checked by default!\n\nNOTE: This should rarely be used (if ever).

possible options:\n// The list of column names to show in the UI\ncolumns = [\n  'Title',\n  'Account',\n  'Budget',\n  'Enabled',\n];\n// We are creating a form array with 4 controls all defaulted to

 [\n      Validators.required,\n    ],\n  ],\n});Disabled\nTo disable the entire radio group, set isDisabled to true:\nDisabled option\nTo disabled only a single option, define the disabled key on the item object:\n// Define items to be passed to the radio group\nitems$: Observable = of([\n  {\n    foo: 'foo_value',\n    bar: 'Foo Display',\n  },\n  {\n    foo: 'bar_value',\n    bar: 'Bar

clickable areas containing content.\nEnable by setting the isVisual flag:\nCustom content\nTsRadioOption now accepts an optional template key with a string template:\nitems$: Observable = of([\n  {\n

These headers should be contained within a parent element\nwith the tsSort directive, which will emit a sortChange event when the user triggers sorting\non the header.\nUsers can trigger the sort header through a mouse click or keyboard action. When this happens, the\ntsSort will emit an sortChange event that contains the ID of the header triggered and the\ndirection to sort (asc or desc).\nChanging the sort order\nBy default, a sort header starts its sorting at asc and then desc. Triggering the sort header\nafter desc will remove sorting.\nTo reverse the sort order for all headers, set the tsSortStart to desc on the tsSort\ndirective. To reverse the order only for a specific header, set the start input only on the header\ninstead.\nTo prevent the user from clearing the sort sort state from an already sorted column, set\ntsSortDisableClear to true on the tsSort to affect all headers, or set disableClear to true on\na specific header.\nDisabling sorting\nIf you want to prevent the user from changing the sorting order of any column, you can use the\ntsSortDisabled binding on the ts-sort, or the disabled on an single ts-sort-header.\nUsing sort with the ts-table\nWhen used on an ts-table header, it is not required to set an ts-sort-header id on because by\ndefault it will use the id of the column.\nAccessibility\nThe aria-label for the sort button can be set in TsSortHeaderIntl.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {\n  Directive,\n  EventEmitter,\n  Input,\n  isDevMode,\n  Output,\n  OnChanges,\n  OnDestroy,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport { coerceBooleanProperty } from '@terminus/ngx-tools/coercion';\nimport { CanDisable, mixinDisabled } from '@angular/material/core';\nimport { Subject } from 'rxjs';\n\nimport {\n  getSortInvalidDirectionError,\n  getSortDuplicateSortableIdError,\n  getSortHeaderMissingIdError,\n} from './sort-errors';\n\n\n/**\n * Define the allowed sort directions for {@link TsSort}\n */\nexport type TsSortDirection\n  = 'asc'\n  | 'desc'\n  | ''\n;\n\n\n/**\n * Interface for a directive that holds sorting state consumed by `TsSortHeaderComponent`\n */\nexport interface TsSortableItem {\n  /**\n   * The id of the column being sorted\n   */\n  id: string;\n\n  /**\n   * Starting sort direction\n   */\n  start: 'asc' | 'desc';\n\n  /**\n   * Whether to disable clearing the sorting state\n   */\n  disableClear: boolean;\n}\n\n\n/**\n * The current sort state\n */\nexport interface TsSortState {\n  /**\n   * The id of the column being sorted\n   */\n  active: string;\n\n  /**\n   * The sort direction\n   */\n  direction: TsSortDirection;\n}\n\n\n// Boilerplate for applying mixins to TsSort.\nexport class TsSortBase {}\nexport const _TsSortMixinBase = mixinDisabled(TsSortBase);\n\n\n/**\n * Container for TsSortables to manage the sort state and provide default sort parameters\n */\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[tsSort]',\n  exportAs: 'tsSort',\n  inputs: ['disabled: tsSortDisabled'],\n})\nexport class TsSortDirective extends _TsSortMixinBase implements CanDisable, OnChanges, OnDestroy {\n  /**\n   * Collection of all registered sortables that this directive manages\n   */\n  private sortables = new Map();\n\n  /**\n   * Used to notify any child components listening to state changes\n   */\n  public _stateChanges = new Subject();\n\n  /**\n   * The id of the most recently sorted TsSortable\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortActive')\n  public active!: string;\n\n  /**\n   * The direction to set when an TsSortable is initially sorted.\n   *\n   * May be overriden by the TsSortable's sort start.\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortStart')\n  public start: 'asc' | 'desc' = 'asc';\n\n  /**\n   * The sort direction of the currently active TsSortable\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortDirection')\n  public set direction(direction: TsSortDirection) {\n    if (isDevMode() && direction && direction !== 'asc' && direction !== 'desc') {\n      throw getSortInvalidDirectionError(direction);\n    }\n    this._direction = direction;\n  }\n  public get direction(): TsSortDirection {\n    return this._direction;\n  }\n  private _direction: TsSortDirection = '';\n\n  /**\n   * Whether to disable the user from clearing the sort by finishing the sort direction cycle.\n   *\n   * May be overriden by the TsSortable's disable clear input.\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortDisableClear')\n  public set disableClear(v: boolean) {\n    this._disableClear = coerceBooleanProperty(v);\n  }\n  public get disableClear() {\n    return this._disableClear;\n  }\n  private _disableClear: boolean = false;\n\n  /**\n   * Event emitted when the user changes either the active sort or sort direction\n   */\n  @Output('tsSortChange')\n  readonly sortChange = new EventEmitter();\n\n\n  /**\n   * Trigger next on all changes\n   */\n  public ngOnChanges(): void {\n    this._stateChanges.next();\n  }\n\n\n  /**\n   * Complete the observable on destroy\n   */\n  public ngOnDestroy(): void {\n    this._stateChanges.complete();\n  }\n\n\n  /**\n   * Register function to be used by the contained TsSortables.

headers\nTo add sorting behavior and styling to a set of table headers, add ts-sort-header to each header\nand provide an id that will identify it. These headers should be contained within a parent element\nwith the tsSort directive, which will emit a sortChange event when the user triggers sorting\non the header.\nUsers can trigger the sort header through a mouse click or keyboard action. When this happens, the\ntsSort will emit an sortChange event that contains the ID of the header triggered and the\ndirection to sort (asc or desc).\nChanging the sort order\nBy default, a sort header starts its sorting at asc and then desc. Triggering the sort header\nafter desc will remove sorting.\nTo reverse the sort order for all headers, set the tsSortStart to desc on the tsSort\ndirective. To reverse the order only for a specific header, set the start input only on the header\ninstead.\nTo prevent the user from clearing the sort sort state from an already sorted column, set\ntsSortDisableClear to true on the tsSort to affect all headers, or set disableClear to true on\na specific header.\nDisabling sorting\nIf you want to prevent the user from changing the sorting order of any column, you can use the\ntsSortDisabled binding on the ts-sort, or the disabled on an single ts-sort-header.\nUsing sort with the ts-table\nWhen used on an ts-table header, it is not required to set an ts-sort-header id on because by\ndefault it will use the id of the column.\nAccessibility\nThe aria-label for the sort button can be set in TsSortHeaderIntl.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import {\n  Directive,\n  EventEmitter,\n  Input,\n  isDevMode,\n  Output,\n  OnChanges,\n  OnDestroy,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport { coerceBooleanProperty } from '@terminus/ngx-tools/coercion';\nimport { CanDisable, mixinDisabled } from '@angular/material/core';\nimport { Subject } from 'rxjs';\n\nimport {\n  getSortInvalidDirectionError,\n  getSortDuplicateSortableIdError,\n  getSortHeaderMissingIdError,\n} from './sort-errors';\n\n\n/**\n * Define the allowed sort directions for {@link TsSort}\n */\nexport type TsSortDirection\n  = 'asc'\n  | 'desc'\n  | ''\n;\n\n\n/**\n * Interface for a directive that holds sorting state consumed by `TsSortHeaderComponent`\n */\nexport interface TsSortableItem {\n  /**\n   * The id of the column being sorted\n   */\n  id: string;\n\n  /**\n   * Starting sort direction\n   */\n  start: 'asc' | 'desc';\n\n  /**\n   * Whether to disable clearing the sorting state\n   */\n  disableClear: boolean;\n}\n\n\n/**\n * The current sort state\n */\nexport interface TsSortState {\n  /**\n   * The id of the column being sorted\n   */\n  active: string;\n\n  /**\n   * The sort direction\n   */\n  direction: TsSortDirection;\n}\n\n\n// Boilerplate for applying mixins to TsSort.\nexport class TsSortBase {}\nexport const _TsSortMixinBase = mixinDisabled(TsSortBase);\n\n\n/**\n * Container for TsSortables to manage the sort state and provide default sort parameters\n */\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[tsSort]',\n  exportAs: 'tsSort',\n  inputs: ['disabled: tsSortDisabled'],\n})\nexport class TsSortDirective extends _TsSortMixinBase implements CanDisable, OnChanges, OnDestroy {\n  /**\n   * Collection of all registered sortables that this directive manages\n   */\n  private sortables = new Map();\n\n  /**\n   * Used to notify any child components listening to state changes\n   */\n  public _stateChanges = new Subject();\n\n  /**\n   * The id of the most recently sorted TsSortable\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortActive')\n  public active!: string;\n\n  /**\n   * The direction to set when an TsSortable is initially sorted.\n   *\n   * May be overriden by the TsSortable's sort start.\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortStart')\n  public start: 'asc' | 'desc' = 'asc';\n\n  /**\n   * The sort direction of the currently active TsSortable\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortDirection')\n  public set direction(direction: TsSortDirection) {\n    if (isDevMode() && direction && direction !== 'asc' && direction !== 'desc') {\n      throw getSortInvalidDirectionError(direction);\n    }\n    this._direction = direction;\n  }\n  public get direction(): TsSortDirection {\n    return this._direction;\n  }\n  private _direction: TsSortDirection = '';\n\n  /**\n   * Whether to disable the user from clearing the sort by finishing the sort direction cycle.\n   *\n   * May be overriden by the TsSortable's disable clear input.\n   */\n  @Input('tsSortDisableClear')\n  public set disableClear(v: boolean) {\n    this._disableClear = coerceBooleanProperty(v);\n  }\n  public get disableClear() {\n    return this._disableClear;\n  }\n  private _disableClear: boolean = false;\n\n  /**\n   * Event emitted when the user changes either the active sort or sort direction\n   */\n  @Output('tsSortChange')\n  readonly sortChange = new EventEmitter();\n\n\n  /**\n   * Trigger next on all changes\n   */\n  public ngOnChanges(): void {\n    this._stateChanges.next();\n  }\n\n\n  /**\n   * Complete the observable on destroy\n   */\n  public ngOnDestroy(): void {\n    this._stateChanges.complete();\n  }\n\n\n  /**\n   * Register function to be used by the contained TsSortables.

These headers should be contained within a parent element\nwith the tsSort directive, which will emit a sortChange event when the user triggers sorting\non the header.\nUsers can trigger the sort header through a mouse click or keyboard action.

Define the table's columns\nDefine the table's columns. Each column definition should be given a unique name and contain the\ncontent for its header and row cells.\nHere's a simple column definition with the name userName. The header cell contains the text Username\nand the row cell will render the name property of each row's data.\n\n  \n    Username\n  \n\n  \n    {{ item.username }}\n  \n2. Define the table's rows\nAfter defining your columns, provide the header and data row templates that will be rendered out by\nthe table. Each row needs to be given a list of the columns that it should contain. The order of the\nnames will define the order of the cells rendered.\nIt is not required to provide a list of all the defined column names, but only the ones that you\nwant to have rendered.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Provide data\nThe column and row definitions now capture how data will render - all that's left is to provide the\ndata itself.\nCreate an instance of TsTableDataSource and set the items to be displayed to the data property.\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\nthis.myDataSource.data = dataToRender;\n  ...\nThe DataSource can be seeded with initial data:\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource(INITIAL_DATA);An interface for your table item can be passed to TsTableDataSource for stricter typing:\nexport interface MyTableItem {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n\nthis.myDataSource: TsTableDataSource = new TsTableDataSource(INITIAL_DATA)4. Full HTML example\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Username\n    \n\n    \n      {{ item.username }}\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      Age\n    \n\n    \n      {{ item.age }}\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nDynamically update table data\nYour data source was created during the bootstraping of your component:\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();Simply assign the new data to myDataSource.data. The table will flush the old data and display the\nnew data:\nthis.myDataSource.data = dataToRender;Dynamic columns\nEnable dynamic columns using a TsSelectComponent:\n// Define a data source\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\n\n// Define all available columns (`TsSelectComponent` requires an array of objects)\nallColumns = [\n  {\n    name: 'Username',\n    myValue: 'username',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Age',\n    myValue: 'age',\n  },\n];Both the TsSelectComponent and the tsRowDef columns input should reference the same ngModel\n(displayedColumns in this example).\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSorting by column\nTo add sorting behavior to the table, add the tsSort directive to the  and add\nts-sort-header to each column header cell that should trigger sorting. Provide the\nTsSortDirective directive to the TsTableDataSource and it will automatically listen for sorting\nchanges and change the order of data rendered by the table.\nBy default, the TsTableDataSource sorts with the assumption that the sorted column's name matches\nthe data property name that the column displays. For example, the following column definition is\nnamed position, which matches the name of the property displayed in the row cell.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Position\n    \n\n    \n      \n      {{ element.position }}\n    \n  \n\nIn your class, get a reference to the TsSortDirective using @ViewChild:\nimport { AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TsSortDirective } from '@terminus/ui';\n\nexport class TableComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n  // Get a reference to the TsSortDirective instance\n  @ViewChild(TsSortDirective) sort: TsSortDirective;\n\n  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    // Subscribe to the sortChange event to reset pagination, fetch new data, etc\n    this.sort.sortChange.subscribe(() => {\n      // Table was sorted - go get new data!\n    });\n  }\n}Row selection\nPossible but not implemented until a valid use-case arises.\nNo-wrap for a column\nSometimes a column's content should not wrap even at small viewport sizes. Adding the directive\nnoWrap=\"true\" to the column will keep then contents from wrapping regardless of the viewport\nwidth.\n\n\n  \n    Created\n  \n  \n    {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n  \nMin-width for a column\nDefining a minimum width for specific columns can help the layout not compress certain columns past\na readable point. Add the directive minWidth and pass it any valid CSS min-width value (100px,\n10%, 12rem, etc..).\n\n\n  \n    Created\n  \n  \n    {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n  \n\nFull example with pagination, sorting and dynamic columns\nimport {\n  Component,\n  ViewChild,\n  AfterViewInit,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { merge, Observable, of } from 'rxjs';\nimport { startWith } from 'rxjs/operators/startWith';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators/map';\nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators/switchMap';\nimport { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators/catchError';\n\nimport {\n  TsTableDataSource,\n  TsSortDirective,\n  TsPaginatorComponent,\n  TsPaginatorMenuItem,\n} from '@terminus/ui';\n\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: `\n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n      \n        \n          Created\n        \n        \n          {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Number\n        \n        \n          {{ item.number }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Title\n        \n        \n          {{ item.title }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          State\n        \n        \n          {{ item.state }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Comments\n        \n        \n          {{ item.comments }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class TableComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n  allColumns: any[] = [\n    {\n      name: 'Created',\n      value: 'created',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Title',\n      value: 'title',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Comments',\n      value: 'comments',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'State',\n      value: 'state',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Number',\n      value: 'number',\n    },\n  ];\n  displayedColumns: string[] = [\n    'created',\n    'number',\n    'title',\n    'state',\n    'comments',\n  ];\n  exampleDatabase: ExampleHttpDao | null;\n  dataSource: TsTableDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\n  resultsLength: number = 0;\n\n  @ViewChild(TsSortDirective)\n  sort: TsSortDirective;\n\n  @ViewChild(TsPaginatorComponent)\n  paginator: TsPaginatorComponent;\n\n\n  constructor(\n    private http: HttpClient,\n  ) {}\n\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    this.exampleDatabase = new ExampleHttpDao(this.http);\n\n    // If the user changes the sort order, reset back to the first page.\n    this.sort.sortChange.subscribe(() => {\n      this.paginator.currentPageIndex = 0;\n    });\n\n    // Fetch new data anytime the sort is changed, the page is changed, or the records shown per\n    // page is changed\n    merge(this.sort.sortChange, this.paginator.pageSelect, this.paginator.recordsPerPageChange)\n      .pipe(\n        startWith({}),\n        switchMap(() => {\n          return this.exampleDatabase.getRepoIssues(\n            this.sort.active,\n            this.sort.direction,\n            this.paginator.currentPageIndex,\n            this.paginator.recordsPerPage,\n          );\n        }),\n        map(data => {\n          console.log('Demo: fetched data: ', data)\n          this.resultsLength = data.total_count;\n\n          return data.items;\n        }),\n        catchError(() => {\n          // Catch if the GitHub API has reached its rate limit.

As a contributor, here are the\nguidelines we would like you to follow.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCode of Conduct\nQuestion or Problem?\nWant a Feature?\nSubmitting an Issue\nSubmitting a Pull Request (PR)\nAfter your pull request is merged\nCoding Rules & Workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nHelp us keep Terminus open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.\nQuestion or Problem?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub repository. Including an issue\nreproduction (via our StackBlitz starter) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nYou can help the team even more and submit a Pull Request with a fix! :pray:\nWant a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nrepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a\nproposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.  Please consider what kind of change it\nis:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\nSubmitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search existing open/closed issues, as your question may have\nalready been answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\nOverview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\nMotivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior\n  is a bug for you\nBrowsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?\nReproduce the Error - provide a live example using our StackBlitz starter or a\n  unambiguous set of steps\nScreenshots - Due to the visual nature of this library, screenshots can help the team triage\n  issues far more quickly than a text description.\nRelated Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?\nSuggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\nYou can file new issues by providing the above information here.\nSubmitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to\nduplicate effort.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\ngit checkout -b 312-my-fix-branch master\nNote: You should prefix your branch name with the associated issue number.\n\n\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\nFollow our coding rules (by verifying all linters pass).\nRun the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are\nautomatically generated from these messages. (for this reason it is often advisable to rebase your\nfeature branch to ensure clear, concise commits)\nPush your branch to GitHub:\ngit push my-fork 312-my-fix-branch\n\n\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to terminus-ui:master.\nIf we suggest changes then:\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run all test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRe-run all linters.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution! :pray:\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the\nmain (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell:\ngit push my-fork --delete 312-my-fix-branch\n\n\nCheck out the master branch:\ngit checkout master -f\n\n\nDelete the local branch:\ngit branch -D 312-my-fix-branch\n\n\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\ngit pull --ff upstream master\n\n\n\nCoding Rules & Workflow\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).\nMost coding styles are enforced via linters\nReference our development documentation for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"dependencies.html":{"url":"dependencies.html","title":"package-dependencies - dependencies","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/animations : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/common : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/core : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/flex-layout : 6.0.0-beta.15\n        \n            @angular/forms : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/http : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser-dynamic : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @angular/router : ^6.0.2\n        \n            @terminus/ngx-tools : ^2.20.0\n        \n            @terminus/ui : ^8.10.1\n        \n            date-fns : 2.0.0-alpha.7\n        \n            highcharts : ^6.1.0\n        \n            rxjs-compat : ^6.0.0-rc.0\n        \n            text-mask-addons : ^3.7.2\n        \n            text-mask-core : ^5.0.1\n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\nTerminus UI Library\nThe library of UI components used for Terminus applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLibrary Purpose\nDocumentation\nAvailable Features\nComponents\nPipes\nServices\nAvailable Validators\n\n\nConstants\nStyle Helpers\n\n\nInstallation\nGlobal Styles\nSCSS Helpers\nContributing\nContributors\nProject Resources\n\n\nLibrary Purpose\nThis library was created to assist Terminus engineers in maintaining a consistent experience across\napplications while following a unified design language.\nThe library is open source with the hopes that others may find solutions and ideas here, as we have\ndone while browsing so many other repositories. While we want to make decisions that are best for\neveryone, in the end, the needs of the Terminus engineering team must come first.\nIf a deviation makes sense for the feature itself, but not for Terminus, we support (and will assist\nin) abstracting the functionality out for generalization.\nThis library is heavily based on Material Design currently. This provides us a way to rely on very\nwell thought out usability and accessibility decisions for areas we have not yet addressed\ninternally. While we hold Material in high regard, we do not believe that all of their decisions are\nbest for the Terminus UI specifically.\nDocumentation\nThe available features table contains links for
