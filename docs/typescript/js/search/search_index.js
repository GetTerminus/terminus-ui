Define the table's columns\nDefine the table's columns. Each column definition should be given a unique name and contain the\ncontent for its header and row cells.\nHere's a simple column definition with the name userName. The header cell contains the text Username\nand the row cell will render the name property of each row's data.\n\n  \n    Username\n  \n\n  \n    {{ item.username }}\n  \n2. Define the table's rows\nAfter defining your columns, provide the header and data row templates that will be rendered out by\nthe table. Each row needs to be given a list of the columns that it should contain. The order of the\nnames will define the order of the cells rendered.\nIt is not required to provide a list of all the defined column names, but only the ones that you\nwant to have rendered.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Provide data\nThe column and row definitions now capture how data will render - all that's left is to provide the\ndata itself.\nCreate an instance of TsTableDataSource and set the items to be displayed to the data property.\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\nthis.myDataSource.data = dataToRender;\n  ...\nThe DataSource can be seeded with initial data:\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource(INITIAL_DATA);An interface for your table item can be passed to TsTableDataSource for stricter typing:\nexport interface MyTableItem {\n  name: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n\nthis.myDataSource: TsTableDataSource = new TsTableDataSource(INITIAL_DATA)4. Full HTML example\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Username\n    \n\n    \n      {{ item.username }}\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      Age\n    \n\n    \n      {{ item.age }}\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nDynamically update table data\nYour data source was created during the bootstraping of your component:\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();Simply assign the new data to myDataSource.data. The table will flush the old data and display the\nnew data:\nthis.myDataSource.data = dataToRender;Dynamic columns\nEnable dynamic columns using a TsSelectComponent:\n// Define a data source\nthis.myDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\n\n// Define all available columns (`TsSelectComponent` requires an array of objects)\nallColumns = [\n  {\n    name: 'Username',\n    myValue: 'username',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Age',\n    myValue: 'age',\n  },\n];Both the TsSelectComponent and the tsRowDef columns input should reference the same ngModel\n(displayedColumns in this example).\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSorting by column\nTo add sorting behavior to the table, add the tsSort directive to the  and add\nts-sort-header to each column header cell that should trigger sorting. Provide the\nTsSortDirective directive to the TsTableDataSource and it will automatically listen for sorting\nchanges and change the order of data rendered by the table.\nBy default, the TsTableDataSource sorts with the assumption that the sorted column's name matches\nthe data property name that the column displays. For example, the following column definition is\nnamed position, which matches the name of the property displayed in the row cell.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Position\n    \n\n    \n      \n      {{ element.position }}\n    \n  \n\nIn your class, get a reference to the TsSortDirective using @ViewChild:\nimport { AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TsSortDirective } from '@terminus/ui';\n\nexport class TableComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n  // Get a reference to the TsSortDirective instance\n  @ViewChild(TsSortDirective) sort: TsSortDirective;\n\n  public ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    // Subscribe to the sortChange event to reset pagination, fetch new data, etc\n    this.sort.sortChange.subscribe(() => {\n      // Table was sorted - go get new data!\n    });\n  }\n}Row selection\nPossible but not implemented until a valid use-case arises.\nNo-wrap for a column\nSometimes a column's content should not wrap even at small viewport sizes. Adding the directive\nnoWrap=\"true\" to the column will keep then contents from wrapping regardless of the viewport\nwidth.\n\n\n  \n    Created\n  \n  \n    {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n  \nMin-width for a column\nDefining a minimum width for specific columns can help the layout not compress certain columns past\na readable point. Add the directive minWidth and pass it any valid CSS min-width value (100px,\n10%, 12rem, etc..).\n\n\n  \n    Created\n  \n  \n    {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n  \n\nFull example with pagination, sorting and dynamic columns\nimport {\n  Component,\n  ViewChild,\n  AfterViewInit,\n} from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of';\nimport { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge';\nimport { startWith } from 'rxjs/operators/startWith';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators/map';\nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators/switchMap';\nimport { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators/catchError';\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';\n\nimport {\n  TsTableDataSource,\n  TsSortDirective,\n  TsPaginatorComponent,\n  TsPaginatorMenuItem,\n} from '@terminus/ui';\n\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: `\n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n      \n        \n          Created\n        \n        \n          {{ item.created_at | date:shortDate }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Number\n        \n        \n          {{ item.number }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Title\n        \n        \n          {{ item.title }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          State\n        \n        \n          {{ item.state }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          Comments\n        \n        \n          {{ item.comments }}\n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class TableComponent implements AfterViewInit {\n  allColumns: any[] = [\n    {\n      name: 'Created',\n      value: 'created',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Title',\n      value: 'title',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Comments',\n      value: 'comments',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'State',\n      value: 'state',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Number',\n      value: 'number',\n    },\n  ];\n  displayedColumns: string[] = [\n    'created',\n    'number',\n    'title',\n    'state',\n    'comments',\n  ];\n  exampleDatabase: ExampleHttpDao | null;\n  dataSource: TsTableDataSource = new TsTableDataSource();\n  resultsLength: number = 0;\n\n  @ViewChild(TsSortDirective)\n  sort: TsSortDirective;\n\n  @ViewChild(TsPaginatorComponent)\n  paginator: TsPaginatorComponent;\n\n\n  constructor(\n    private http: HttpClient,\n  ) {}\n\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    this.exampleDatabase = new ExampleHttpDao(this.http);\n\n    // If the user changes the sort order, reset back to the first page.\n    this.sort.sortChange.subscribe(() => {\n      this.paginator.currentPageIndex = 0;\n    });\n\n    // Fetch new data anytime the sort is changed, the page is changed, or the records shown per\n    // page is changed\n    merge(this.sort.sortChange, this.paginator.pageSelect, this.paginator.recordsPerPageChange)\n      .pipe(\n        startWith({}),\n        switchMap(() => {\n          return this.exampleDatabase.getRepoIssues(\n            this.sort.active,\n            this.sort.direction,\n            this.paginator.currentPageIndex,\n            this.paginator.recordsPerPage,\n          );\n        }),\n        map(data => {\n          console.log('Demo: fetched data: ', data)\n          this.resultsLength = data.total_count;\n\n          return data.items;\n        }),\n        catchError(() => {\n          // Catch if the GitHub API has reached its rate limit.

   \n\n    \n        Adding sort to table headers\nTo add sorting behavior and styling to a set of table headers, add ts-sort-header to each header\nand provide an id that will identify it. These headers should be contained within a parent element\nwith the tsSort directive, which will emit a sortChange event when the user triggers sorting\non the header.\nUsers can trigger the sort header through a mouse click or keyboard action. When this happens, the\ntsSort will emit an sortChange event that contains the ID of the header triggered and the\ndirection to sort (asc or desc).\nChanging the sort order\nBy default, a sort header starts its sorting at asc and then desc. Triggering the sort header\nafter desc will remove sorting.\nTo reverse the sort order for all headers, set the tsSortStart to desc on the tsSort\ndirective.
