# Acknowledgment

> _noun._ the action of expressing or displaying gratitude or appreciation for something.


We have borrowed heavily from existing libraries and plugins to create this library. Many times the
library in question would be perfect for our needs. However we may still decide to build it
internally so that we can provide a unified API for the Terminus engineering team.

For most needs we highly recommend using the original libraries since they will be focused
more on the communities needs.
